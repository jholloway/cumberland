This is a simple tool to help with copyediting. It automatically highlights text in a textarea in different colors according to severity levels of the issues detected using regular expression rules.

There is also a text manipulation tool that allows you to quickly lowercase or uppercase text, remove extra spaces, remove bullets and leading spaces, and more.

The built-in rules are explained within the textarea and are based on the ones the Metro Nashville ITS Digital Experience team uses to enforce clean text content on the Nashville.gov public website. It should be easy to modify the rules to fit your needs.

This tool heavily uses **[highlight-within-textarea](https://lonekorean.github.io/highlight-within-textarea/)** by [@lonekorean](https://github.com/lonekorean).
