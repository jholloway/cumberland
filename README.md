This is a simple tool to help with copyediting. It automatically highlights text in a textarea in different colors according to severity levels of the issues detected using regular expression rules.

The built-in rules are used to enforce clean text content on the Nashville.gov public website, but it should be easy to modify the rules to fit your needs.

This tool heavily uses **[highlight-within-textarea](https://lonekorean.github.io/highlight-within-textarea/)** by [@lonekorean](https://github.com/lonekorean).
